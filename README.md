<b>**THIS SCRIPT IS NOT FOR LOCAL PC (localhost) AND IT IS FOR ADVANCED USERS!**</b><br>
This script gives you a base and foundation if you're willing to install your own Ripple instance. You’re to think for yourself. Ripple is not a stack system where Ripple/I document everything so you’ll need a basic understanding of how unix or GNU/Linux systems and full stack web applications work to be able to set up Ripple properly and work out with problems efficiently when necessary.<br>
* Check out <a href="https://github.com/light-ripple/Light-Ripple-Windows/">Light-Ripple-Windows</a> if you want to host a local Ripple server on your windows system.</a>
* You might want to look at Ripple's wiki(old): https://github.com/osuripple/ripple/wiki/How-to-setup-ripple
